            "East Baton Rouge Parish EMS has been utilizing the Harrison Battery system on one of our ambulances for approximately 6 months.  During this time the system has performed perfectly,   It has reduced our “idle” time by approximately 50% with a very notable savings in fuel ( on an average of 0ver $800.00) per month and has extended the maintenance on our vehicle greatly another notable cost savings plus reducing our carbon footprint greatly.  All feedback from our crews has been extremely positive.     EMS has our vehicles serviced every 200 hours.  Which equated to being done approximately once a month if not sooner.   It has also extended our warranty on the new unit greatly with less hours on the motor and chassis as a whole.     EMS especially appreciates the instant feed back on the system through the application for computers and electronic devices.   The customer service is by far some of the best EMS has ever received especially with customizing the settings on the system for our specific needs.",

            "Frazer has been working with Harrison and our local sales rep, Azael Garcia, since late 2019 and the partnership has been valuable to our organization. As a provider of emergency vehicles, reducing idling time is crucial to our customers' operational success and Harrison's h-Power idle mitigation system has met our expectations. In some cases, we've seen a reduction in idling time by more than 50%, which has not only improved our customers' fuel efficiency reducing costs, but can extend the life in-service of the vehicle enhancing our customer experience.",
            "One of the things we appreciate about Harrison is their deep interest in how their product impacts our operations and the end user experience. They take a collaborative approach, always looking for ways to improve and make sure their solutions are meeting our customers needs.",
            "Having Harrison located in Houston has been a bonus for us as it makes it easy for our teams to meet and work together. We feel like we have a true partner in Harrison and Azael, and we're grateful for their commitment to our success."

I have called on multiple occasions with very old units still in active service and the Harrison Team has always been there to support our efforts, going above and beyond to get us educated and supplied with the parts to keep our customers running.",

The efforts by Troy Padgett, and Harrison Hydra-Gen’s Engineers, was unmeasurable and their attention to detail during the project was great.  As a result of everyone’s efforts, our end-user was so pleased with the result that they ordered a second fire apparatus with the hydraulic system almost immediately.  Harrison Hydra-Gen’s commitment to ensuring that all parties involved were completely satisfied exemplifies their desire to be a first-class company.",

The technical assistance you got set up for us was a great help in facilitating the install, especially  getting the hydraulic pump exchanged for us and then checking back later to make sure everything was working correctly. Thanks also for getting a maintenance class set up for the technicians. Looks like we will be retrofitting another truck in the near future, I’ll get with you as soon as I can get the truck over here and see what we need.",

            "In the past year we have installed Harrison Hydra-Gen Generators in the units that we build and refurb for customers around the world. Harrison is the generator of choice for us because of their versatility, ease of install, and most of all the because of the service we receive from the Harrison Hydra-Gen Staff. Azael Garcia is phenomenal when it comes to servicing our account, our staff, and our customers. Between Azael and John Mann we could not ask for a better service team, our questions are answered immediately, our concerns are addressed with professionalism not seen in today’s business climate, and resolution is ALWAYS at the forefront. Our customers are in the world of 24/7/365 and every job is mission critical. When issues arise, we never get the typical response of “We will have to get back to you” from Harrison Hydra-Gen, all we ever hear is “We are on it” and that is where this service team jumps into action and doesn’t quit until the job is done and the customer is up and running. Recently a customer was in the field when a generator unit started leaking fluid, Azael Garcia coordinated with the customer to set up diagnostics and repair. When the job got extended and the unit could not return to its operating base, Azael jumped into action, grabbed a service technician and drove to the customers location. After minimal diagnostics, the technician found the issue, and made the repair. In today’s environment you just can’t find service like that. Thank you. This is why Harrison Hydra-Gen is and will continue to be our first call for our power generation needs",
